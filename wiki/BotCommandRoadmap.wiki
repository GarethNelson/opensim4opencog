#Roadmap of what BotCommand is:

Bot commands wrap complex operations into callable forms.

Examples:
 (say "hello world")
 (setmaster "Anne Ogborn")
 (im "Anne Ogborn" "Hi there!")
 (sysvar UseMoveSpeed 2)
 (setbot "Testbot Miles")

Most command may takes strings for arguments. When they do these strings are expected to have a default interpretation.   Like _setmaster_ expects an avatar name.
