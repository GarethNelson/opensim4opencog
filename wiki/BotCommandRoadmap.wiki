#Roadmap of what BotCommand is

Bot commands wrap complex operations into callable forms.

Most command may takes strings for arguments. Sometimes, these strings are expected to have a default interpretation.   Like *setmaster* expects an _avatar_ name.  *say* uses a free form _message_ string.  *im* _avatar_ and _message_.



Examples:
{{{
 (setmaster "Anne Ogborn")
 (say "hello world")
 (im "Anne Ogborn" "Hi there!")
 (moveprim "yellow cube" (v3 34 128 22))
 (sysvar UseMoveSpeed 2)
 (setbot "Testbot Miles")
}}}
