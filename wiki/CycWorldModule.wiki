= Introduction =

CYC has a notion of per-understood content:   Agents, Hair, Walking, Being Surprised, PortableObjects like Shovels and Pants.

Also has a notion for committing actions:  PointingAtSomething, Movement-TranslationEvent, SittingOnFurnature.

Obviously these things have been designed to reflect a WorldLikeOurs.  And OpenSim/Secondlife was also designed to be as well. 

The purpose of the CycWorldModule is to easily use and understand (aline) existing OpenSim and SecondLife worlds with prebuilt content into CYC KBs.


People observe that the content used in Video games is not represented at some atom by atom basis (good or bad Knowledge Engineering?).  That somehow the video game programmers cheated by making a bird flying in the air is only a transparent cube with an animated gif.

That bird has coded into it:
 # A Name: "filthy bird 777"
 # A natural flying pattern (albeit only a low circle around the sky-box)
 # Uses texture: "AnimatedWings.gif"
 # Drops poop at random intervals ("rezzes" a new object "poop" effected by gravity) contains: "LeaveScatScript.lsl" 
 # If the bird is contacted by another object it squawks in complaint: contains: "DontTouchMe.lsl"


SimCycifier's job is to pick up on some of these facts and assert them into CYC:

 # filthy bird is Bird-Individual777 and is probably a Bird a low amount  cleanliness.
 # Object has a found in location and is moving
 # "AnimatedWings.gif" means it is probably a visible.
 # (containsScript Bird-Individual777 "LeaveScatScript.lsl")
 # (containsScript Bird-Individual777 "DontTouchMe.lsl")

CycL KE's Job:
 * "LeaveScatScript.lsl" => Animal, performsFrequentlyFn whatnot
 * "DontTouchMe.lsl" => make assertions that will describe cause-effect

Cyc's job is to deduce

 try to avoid being under the bird
 may throw stones at the bird to make it squawk.
