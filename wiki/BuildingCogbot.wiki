  # Install .NET 2.0 and 3.5 (.NET 2.0 might be optional.. i dont know) (2.0 came with visual studio 2005 and 3.5 comes with visual studio 2008)
  # install swi-prolog development version 64 and 32 bit
  # make sure c:\program files\pl\lib\swipl.lib is there
  # install a cmdline svn client
  # checkout trunk from svn into a folder like c:\development\opensim4opencog\current\
  # Open a command window and cd to your root cogbot directory. 
  # Run include-chatbot.bat.
  # Run runprebuild.bat.
  # In VisualStudio 2008 or 2010 (full versions) Open Cogbot_VS9_ChatBot.sln
  # allow visual studio to upgrade your project if needbe
  # right click on swicli project in SwiProlog folder, choose properties
  # under Common Properties, you will see one or two missing references. 
  # Remove them, then add Swicli.Library and SWICLITestDLL by clicking 'Add New Reference...' button and on Projects tab select these.
