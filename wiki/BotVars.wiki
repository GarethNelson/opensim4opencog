#description of botvars

= Introduction =

Cogbot is composed of a number of interacting plugins (yay, we love plugins!). The primary semantic way of interchanging information among plugins is botvars.


== Using botvars from prolog ==

== using botvars from botcmd ==

== AIML botvars ==

AIML users will be familiar with get and set. Get and set are used to record information about the user during an interaction- e.g. 

bot: what is your favorite movie?
user: it is Castaway On The Moon
bot: I haven't seen Castaway On The Moon

(Note that we also could have used the `<that />` tag) 

The bot remembers the user's favorite movie via the set tag in AIML, defined in [http://www.alicebot.org/TR/2001/WD-aiml/#section-set AIML 1.0.1 spec, section 7.4.1], which looks like

{{{
<set name="favorite_movie" >
}}}

and recovers it via the [http://www.alicebot.org/TR/2001/WD-aiml/#section-get get tag], so the category might look like

{{{
<category>
   <pattern>_ is <set name="favorite_movie">*</set></pattern>
   <template>I haven't seen <get name="favorite_movie" /></template>
</category>
}}}


WRONG - not needed, local dictionary is per user.

Notice that favorite_movie refers to the user's favorite movie. If we have several users we might want to keep separate name spaces for them. Get and set take an additional dict parameter.

{{{
<category>
   <pattern>_ is <set dict="FluffyBunny Resident" name="favorite_movie">*</set></pattern>
   <template>I haven't seen <get dict="FluffyBunny Resident" name="favorite_movie" /></template>
</category>
}}}

This of course has the user's name hard coded, a deficiency we'll correct in a moment.

We might also want to record information about the bot itself. This is done in the dictionary 'bot'. AIML contains a shorthand equivilent `<bot name="foo" />`  for `<get dict="bot" name="foo" />`. The dictionary 'user' is the default dict.

Cogbot botvars are effectively AIML vars. So, for example, we can introduce the bot's master's name with   `<get dict="

of course we're more likely to want to store 

now explain how bot is slightly different

dict="user"   dict="bot"

dict and user names

dict and bot names


every request in aiml has local dictionary, which is the name of the person making the request to the bot (usually the person who spoke to the bot).  


name with dot doesn't use local dictionary

$vars allowed anywhere in aiml
