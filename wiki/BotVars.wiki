#description of botvars

= Introduction =

Cogbot is composed of a number of interacting plugins (yay, we love plugins!). The primary semantic way of interchanging information among plugins is botvars.


== Using botvars from prolog ==

== using botvars from botcmd ==

== AIML botvars ==

AIML users will be familiar with get and set. Get and set are used to record information about the user during an interaction- e.g. 

bot: what is your favorite movie?
user: it is Castaway On The Moon
bot: I haven't seen Castaway On The Moon

The bot remembers user's favorite movie via the set tag in AIML, defined in [http://www.alicebot.org/TR/2001/WD-aiml/#section-set AIML 1.0.1 spec, section 7.4.1], which looks like

{{{
<set name="favorite_movie" >
}}}

so the category might look like

{{{
<category>
   <pattern>_ is <set name="favorite movie">*</set></pattern>
   <template>I haven't seen <get name="favorite_movie" /></template>
</category>
}}}

this is done via the get tag in AIML, defined in [http://www.alicebot.org/TR/2001/WD-aiml/#section-get AIML 1.0.1 spec, section 7.1.6.1], which looks like

{{{
<get name="" />
}}}

which tells the AIML interpreter that it should substitute the contents of a predicate, if that predicate has a value defined. If the predicate has no value defined, the AIML interpreter should substitute the empty string "".

now explain how bot is slightly different

dict="user"   dict="bot"

dict and user names

dict and bot names
