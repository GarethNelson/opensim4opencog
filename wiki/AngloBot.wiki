#Design for a hillpeople world understanding authoring system

= Introduction =

   Cogbot is a server written for .NET that connects several avatars
   acting as "bots" to OpenSim or Second Life. The system is intended
   to provide basic features programmers need to populate a prebuilt
   virtual environments with non player characters doing "interesting"
   things. 

Interesting, in human terms, means that the actions have meaning and make sense.  This requires some 'intelligence' tools.

As of this writing we've taken the Hill People example as far as we can without a more powerful tool. AngloBot will be that tool.

Anglobot is a working title.

= Manifesto =

Overarching design principles:
  * Development is a total activity. We want a system that supports running test runs, updating, and debugging as an integrated, humane activity.
  * Better tools are needed to build a palace than a garden shed.
  * Formal power and semantics are interesting, but so is ease of use.
  * We appreciate the design decisions that lead to Inform 7, but recognize that their design solutions are for their domain, not ours.
  * Our users come first
  * Including technical details and requirements, making the learning curve more formidable, affects not only non/less technical users, but busy technical users as well. Complexity has a cost.
  * To understand is to relate actions to utility. This is the Papertian view and Gibson's ecological view.
  * PDDL is our machine code.
  * Our interpreter is opinionated. It understands some fundamental things that are awkward to encode in the user's language, e.g. that carrying a thing means it moves with the carrier.

= What we tell the system =

  * Snippets - sections of a plan that a planner can combine to create plans by HTN.
  * Ontology - facts about the nature of the world, in a form that can be converted to snippets.
  * Utility - facts about the value of doing things.

Skein - like Inform 7  (how do we 'reset')?

GUI tool to observe sysvars, botvars
