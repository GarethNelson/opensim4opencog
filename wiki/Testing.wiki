#How to use the test framework

= Introduction =

Testing a virtual robot requires unusual techniques when compared to the average web application. However, the theory remains the same. Tests must be:

  * Fast  - many tests require actions by the bot, so we're as fast as we can be
  * Automatic - it's difficult to automatically test for various actions by thebot.
  * Independent - the simulator tends to retain state. Logging the bot on takes 30 seconds or more, so fast and independent tend to conflict. In practice, we leave the bot logged in.
  * Repeatable - Physics related items are not repeatable, and many bugs are due to message failures, so repeatablity is a constant struggle.

To run the path finding tests:

load cogbot/test/pathfindplayground.oar into an empty sim

run bin/runcogbot.pl

wait til the bot loads

Move the bot into the sim if necessary
