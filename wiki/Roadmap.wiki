 # learn C#, 
 # get latest compiling from Doug,  
 # make a demo project, probably an area populated by some bots

=== later ===
 # documentation
 # Add 'not' to the adjectives
 # Look for other improvements to the command language
 # Integrate talespin to take a goal and rule set and make a list of actions.


== dmiles ==

 # Help Annie get compiling again
 # get low level cogobt movement to use prim pusher
 # Make a publically downloadable version of opecog (small version ) 
then an overlay pack that has all the chatbot stuff in it

 # Progress to ProgramK Prolog IAML bot
