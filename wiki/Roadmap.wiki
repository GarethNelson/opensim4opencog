#labels Phase-Support
#Roadmap of Cogbot

= Long Term Roadmap =

This is our long term strategy. We can change things on
the ongoing roadmap fairly easily, but should try to 'stag the course' 
with these items

 # Binary release - roughly May 15. Have a prebuilt binary release of Cogbot available for download from google code.

 # Afghan Village - roughtly July 1. A simple demo area with bots moving around, doing activities, and responding to each other and to humans in the area - a demo of basic cogbot functionality. 

 # Public Release - roughly Sept 15.  Having all the existing components working well enough, and cogbot well enough packaged, documented, etc. that we can begin to attract users, make public announcements, and be 'alpha'.



== needed for public release ==

==== COMPLETED ====
 * Build system sane
 * multiple AV's
 * pathfinding (to level we've seen)
 * headless mode
 * mono - works fine on Redhat with BUGs on Ubuntu
 * AIML interpreter hasn't been worked on in 9 months, needs to be working - COMPLETED (need Docs?)

==== DELAYED ====
 * Complete regression test coverage - DELAYED
 * setup and run pathfinding unit tests  - DELAYED (good enough)
 * Bug list reasonably clean 
 * Sims working - DELAYED
 * some tale-spinnish thing

==== TODO GENERAL ====

 * installer finished - INPROGRESS
 * PR plan
 * website
 * Example files made
 * Some level of documentation of everything
 * Every component currently in the installer's component list must work well enough to be useable.
 * ABCL interpreter working - 


==== TODO ANNIE ====
 # move hillpeople to botvars
 # make hillpeople do various actions (hunt, fish, etc) triggered by some debug method
 # make hillpeople trigger actions from aiml and be able to answer questions like 'what are you doing?'  'what do you think Otopopo is doing?'

==== TODO DOUG ====
 # prolog API to botvars,sysvars
 # get AIML module ready for installer
 # botcmds using generic parser map
 # document manifesto
 # Overview of current set of services: like botvar namespaces

 # BotCommand parser using CommandInfo to "parse" the commands separately - TODO
 # easy deployment - Installer needs Cogbot integration (Doug)
