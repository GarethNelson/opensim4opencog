#Roadmap of Cogbot

= Long Term Roadmap =

This is our long term strategy. We can change things on
the ongoing roadmap fairly easily, but should try to 'stag the course' 
with these items

 # Binary release - roughly May 15. Have a prebuilt binary release of Cogbot available for download from google code.

 # Afghan Village - roughtly July 1. A simple demo area with bots moving around, doing activities, and responding to each other and to humans in the area - a demo of basic cogbot functionality. 

 # Public Release - roughly Sept 15.  Having all the existing components working well enough, and cogbot well enough packaged, documented, etc. that we can begin to attract users, make public announcements, and be 'alpha'.


=== Components to be in the release ===

== needed for public release ==

 * PR plan
 * website
 * Example files made
 * Some level of documentation of everything

 * Build system sane - COMPLETED
 * installer finished - INPROGRESS
 * Complete regression test coverage - DELAYED
 * setup and run pathfinding unit tests  - DELAYED (good enough)
 * Bug list reasonably clean 
 * Every component currently in the installer's component list must work well enough to be useable.
 * AIML interpreter hasn't been worked on in 9 months, needes to be working - COMPLETED (need Docs?)
 * ABCL interpreter working - TODO
 * Sims working - DELAYED
 * BotCommand parser using CommandInfo to "parse" the commands separately - TODO

 * easy deployment - Installer needs Cogbot integration (Doug)
 * pathfinding (to level we've seen) COMPLETED
