#labels Phase-Support
#Roadmap of Cogbot

= Long Term Roadmap =

This is our long term strategy. We can change things on
the ongoing roadmap fairly easily, but should try to 'stag the course' 
with these items

 # Binary release - roughly May 15. Have a prebuilt binary release of Cogbot available for download from google code.

 # Afghan Village - roughtly July 1. A simple demo area with bots moving around, doing activities, and responding to each other and to humans in the area - a demo of basic cogbot functionality. 

 # Public Release - roughly Sept 15.  Having all the existing components working well enough, and cogbot well enough packaged, documented, etc. that we can begin to attract users, make public announcements, and be 'alpha'.

== needed for demo project ==

 * multiple AV's - COMPLETED
 * easy deployment - Installer needs Cogbot integration (Doug)
 * pathfinding (to level we've seen) COMPLETED
 * some aiml or aiml-ish implementation integrated - INPROGRESS - Kino
 * some tale-spinnish thing
 * headless mode - COMPLETED
 * mono - COMPLETED works fine on Redhat with BUGs on Ubuntu 

=== Components to be in the release ===



== needed for public release ==

 * Build system sane
 * installer finished
 * Complete regression test coverage
 * setup and run pathfinding unit tests
 * Bug list reasonably clean
 * Every component currently in the installer's cvomponent list must work well enough to be useable.
 * AIML interpreter hasn't been worked on in 9 months, needes to be working
 * ABCL interpreter working
 * Sims working
 * BotCommand parser using CommandInfo to "parse" the commands separately
 
 * PR plan
 * website
 * Example files made
 * Some level of documentation of everything



= The ongoing roadmap =

Please edit this only after some concensus on roadmap


= Direction =

== Annie == 
=== first ===

 # move hillpeople to botvars
 # make hillpeople do various actions (hunt, fish, etc) triggered by some debug method
 # make hillpeople trigger actions from aiml and be able to answer questions like 'what are you doing?'  'what do you think Otopopo is doing?'
 

=== later ===

 # documentation
 # Add 'not' to the adjectives
 # Look for other improvements to the command language


== dmiles ==

 # simexport
 # Help Annie get compiling again
 # get low level cogbot movement to use prim pusher - now the default -SOLVED- was bug
 # Make a publically downloadable version of cogbot (small version ) 
then an overlay pack that has all the chatbot stuff in it
 # revisit RTParser and see if there is a salvageable chatbot in there somewhere - COMPLETED (Kino confirms it's working for Hanson)
 
 # Progress to ProgramK Prolog AIML bot
