#labels Phase-Support
#Roadmap of Cogbot

= Long Term Roadmap =

This is our long term strategy. We can change things on
the ongoing roadmap fairly easily, but should try to 'stag the course' 
with these items

 # Afghan Village - a simple demo area with bots moving around, doing activities, and responding to each other and to humans in the area - a demo of basic cogbot functionality.

 # Public Release - Having all the existing components working well enough, and cogbot well enough packaged, documented, etc. that we can begin to attract users.

== needed for demo project ==

 * multiple AV's - COMPLETED
 * easy deployment - Installer needs Cogbot integration (Doug)
 * pathfinding (to level we've seen) COMPLETED
 * some aiml or aiml-ish implementation integrated - INPROGRESS - Kino
 * some tale-spinnish thing
 * headless mode - COMPLETED
 * mono - COMPLETED works fine on Redhat with BUGs on Ubuntu 

== needed for public release ==

 * Build system sane
 *
